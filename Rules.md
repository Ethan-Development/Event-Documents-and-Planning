# Star Hack 2024 - Summer Edition - Rules and Guidelines
Please note that Star Hacks 2024 Summer Edition will be refered to as SH24-S
## Rules
- A team may consist of at least one but no more than four participants. Please note that all prizes are awarded per project, and will be up to each team to distribute between themselves.

- Hackathon participants must submit through Foundance to have their project evaluated.

- Teams can of course gain advice and support from organizers, volunteers, sponsors, and others.

- All work on a project should be done at the hackathon. Cross Submissions are allowed if ALL work is completed during the duration of SH24-S

- Teams can use an idea they had before the event.

- Teams can work on ideas that have already been done. Hacks do not have to be “innovative”. If somebody wants to work on a common idea they should be allowed to do so and should be judged on the quality of their hack. These days it’s hard to find something that’s fully original and teams might not know an idea has been done before anyway.

- Teams can use libraries, frameworks, or open-source code in their projects. Working on a project before the event and open-sourcing it for the sole purpose of using the code during the event is against the spirit of the rules and is not allowed.

- Adding new features to existing projects is allowed. Judges will only consider new functionality introduced or new features added during the hackathon in determining the winners. **Please be clear and indicate which updates are new, and include the source code.**

- Teams must stop hacking once the time is up. There will be a late submissions period of 2 hours after the event for any submission difficulties.

- Projects that violate the Foundance Code of Conduct are not allowed.

- All the Prizes and the Prize categories are decided on the sole discretion of Star Hacks and can be modified at any time under requisite circumstances. Star Hacks is not liable to give any notice for the same.

- Teams can be disqualified from the competition at the organizers' discretion. Reasons might include but are not limited to breaking the Competition Rules, breaking the Code of Conduct, or other unsporting behavior.

## Additional specific guidelines for our Hackathon:
- We encourage all teams to submit a 2 minute or less demo video.

- All team members must be a part of our Hackathon Discord: https://discord.gg/ueVrmAfbsn

- Your video must be created during the hackathon. 

- Your code **is highly encouraged** to be available in some sort of public repository... You can be graded higher this way.

- If you're continuing work on an old project, you MUST specify in your Devpost submission form what was worked on 1) before the hackathon and 2) during the hackathon.
